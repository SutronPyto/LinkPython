Threshold based sampling is below

The thresholds must  be such that they are increasing up to a peak point after which they are decreasing.
An example of such thresholds: 
[1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 3.2, 2.2, 1.2]

For the ascending points (points 1.1, 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1), the system will trigger the sampler 
    if two consecutive turbidity readings exceed the threshold. 
For the descending points (points 3.2, 2.2, 1.2), 
    the system will trigger if the two values are below the threshold. 

As each thresholds is crossed, the next one becomes relevant.  If the next threshold is 
beyond the triggering value, it is automatically crossed too.

For example (using the thresholds above), if the initial values were 3.3, the system would
trigger the sampler and then move to threshold 4.1

Once all the trigger points have been achieved, 
the system will no longer trigger the sampler until the threshold reset 

Threshold reset:
Once the turbidity value reads below a user set ‘threshold reset’ value, 
the system will reset the triggering program.  At this point, the sampler may be triggered 
as if the program had just started.  The bottle counter is unaffected by this reset.
