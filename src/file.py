# Example:  Demonstrates file operations
"""

With the addition of an SD card to the system, file operations become useful.
This module provides examples of file operations on the SD card.

Notes

* "SD/" is the root folder for the SD drive.  "SD/TX1" is an example subfolder
* Use forward slash / to separate folders and files e.g. "SD/folder/file.txt"
* FAT32 is the only supported file system
* The system automatically mounts the SD card
* The command line interface supports advanced file operations (please see user manual)
* Files may be transmitted to an FTP server (please see user manual)
* The "SD/TX1", "SD/TX2", etc. folders are used to hold files for transmissions
* Transmitted files are automatically deleted


MicroPython

* MicroPython file operations have some minor differences from Python 3.5
* include uos to use file operations
* use uos.exists() to see if a file exists (there is no uos.path module)
* seek is limited to files under 1GB
